# Adaptive-Learning-Locking
A Moodle Plugin that adapts the learning path to student's prior knowledge using the Activity Locking feature.

With this plugin will be possible to hide (or make available) assets to students based on their level of preparation on certain topics.
This will allow users to focus their attention and energies only on the topics for which there are gaps, hiding assets containing notions previously acquired by the student.
